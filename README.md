# Vim Plugin Nursery
A custom nix channel serving half-baked vim plugins.

## Purpose
One of my few joys is writing vim plugins, but not every idea is a good one. I need a place to experiment without fully committing to a new repository.

Additionally, this functions as a custom [nix](nixos.org/) channel serving my vim plugins. The less polished ones don't belong in [nixpkgs](https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs) yet.

Feel free to copy anything that looks interesting, but be warned that it's mostly alpha quality.
